              <p>The Yangtze River China's largest river and the world's third largest river runs through about 9 provinces in China. Each of the provinces have millions of people that live or had lived near the river. A third of China population live around that area. The people of China who lived on these provinces depends on these waters to maintain their lifestyle. This map here shows how many people who live in these provinces that reached the Yangtze River.</p>

                    Humanitarian Impacts <i>By Mark Ernst</i></h2>
              <p>The humanitarian effects and repercussions following the construction of the Three Gorges Dam have been severe. Due to flooding upstream from the dam in the Yangtze River, many villages, cities and towns have been forced to relocate residents far away from their homes, divorcing them from land that holds significant historical and cultural significance. In this interactive map, one can explore some of the sites relevant to the human story of loss and transition as the river adjusts to the massive re-engineering of a historical waterway. The landscape of Central China has been forever changed, and though the dam brings enormous benefit and enrichment to many citizens, there are also many tales of loss, resettlement and even death. This map aims to tell some of those stories, and give geographic reference to the viewer, allowing for an immersive look into the changing lives along the Yangtze.</p>

              <h2 class="display-6">The Dam's Impact on the Yangtze River Fishery <i>by Dillon Epping</i></h2>
              <p>Not only has the Yangtze River Basin, specifically near the dam, experienced social and economic impacts, but ecological as well. The river and its tributaries are home to a great diversity of fish species, many of which are endemic only to the river basin. With the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, many Ichthyologists are concerned over the potential loss of fish biodiversity. In <i>"Assessing fish distribution and threats to fish biodiversity in the Yangtze River Basin, China"</i> by Shaowen Ye et al. (2013), they discuss the human impacts, specifically the Three Gorges Dam on fish species in the river basin. The map (right) is an interactive version of a “Figure 1.” from that paper. The map displays the number of fish species that are threatened, endangered or extinct in the river basin. The basin is broken up into 5 separate areas or reaches, with the dam located in the “Upper Reach”. The dam is problematic because it blocks migration routes for catadromous fishes upstream and anadromous fishes downstream. This is concerning for spawning and overall populations of fish that already have critically low numbers. It is also troubling because the greatest number of fish species exist in the “Riverhead” and “Upper Reach” making that migration even more crucial. The “Upper Reach” has the highest number of fish species listed as endangered and vulnerable making the impact of the dam even greater. Research and monitoring will need to continue, in order to properly assess the impacts of the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze River fishery going forward.</p>
